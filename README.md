# kuka-painting-interface
To control a KUKA KR 6 R500 Z200 SCARA robot for a painting task using a custom user interface. The robotic system is simplified to a 3-DoF RRT configuration, where the final joint is translational and the last rotational joint is assumed fixed.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Title: KUKA SCARA Painting Robot with Custom Interface

This project is developed as part of the **Robot Mechanisms** course* semester at **Friedrichâ€“Alexander University (FAU)**.

Developed a custom control interface and conducted kinematic modeling for a **KUKA KR 6 R500 Z200 SCARA robot** to perform a painting task.
